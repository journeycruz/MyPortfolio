# Portfolio
New portfolio using ReactJS (Files imported from corrupt repository). To view work history commits please visit <a href="https://github.com/journeycruz/Portfolio">this repository</a>.

There are still a few bugs to work out. I need to program a message to pop up when a user sends an email through the input form on the page. Also, I would like to add more pictures, animations, and better project descriptions over the next few weeks. For now, there are six projects listed with links to the corresponding repositories. From the repos you can navigate to the deployed website for each project.
